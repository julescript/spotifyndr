## Reflection

This was a 48 hours challenge project (from Design to Dev) built during a quarantine weekend. Project goals included using react core concepts learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Axios and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
